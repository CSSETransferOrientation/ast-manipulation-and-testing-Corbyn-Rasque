# Binary Operator Simplifier 


## Scope of Work

All specifications for this project have been implemented, including the extra Zero Multiplication & Constant Folding functionality. A suite of tests have been included and run automatically on file open. New tests can be added to the testbench folder (inputs should include a title for the test as the first line in the input file for identification, followed by the prefix equation to test). These unit tests will run & complete from within a single all-encompassing test, for which the results will print out as a simple pass/fail.

## Learning Outcomes

My two biggest takeaways from this assignment have been better familiarity with unit testing and using Github for version control. The project was a nice foray into pulling, committing & pushing from a terminal, and setting up the unit tests gave good insight into how to go about structuring & writing tests for future projects.

## Final Thoughts

I enjoyed this project! The difficulty was very reasonable and debugging was straightforwards, in that was generally limited to simple typos or logic errors that were easy to sus out with the unit test cases.

### Likes

Beyond unit testing and git, it was nice to experiment around with breakpoints and step-in, step-out more when dealing with bugs in recursion. I'd used them in the past, but reviewing the functionality in class and while doing this project was useful (especially since this project is quite recursion-centered). Plus the topic overall is quite defined & straightforwards in implementation, meaning the focus stays on learning toolchains & debugging techniques, and not in struggling with writing logic.

### Dislikes

None!
